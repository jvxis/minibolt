Guys, I made a light version of minibolt here, without bitcoind. Just with the setup configurations, tor, i2p, and lnd. In this case, I used LND via git pull and compiled it to ensure the latest available version.

Use: User: admin Pass: lightning to login and then change password using passwd

The lnd.conf is complete and commented, for now in tor only, since it is not possible to have two clearnets without changing ports and everything else.
You need to point in lnd.conf to the bitcoin node of whoever wants to use it.

'sudo nano /data/lnd/lnd.conf'

Change this part to your bitcoind credentials

`# External Bitcoin Node - Please change to your bitcoin node IP, and your RPCUSER and RPCPASS
bitcoind.rpchost=192.168.68.74:8332
bitcoind.rpcuser=jvxminibolt
bitcoind.rpcpass=Suc31709801%%
bitcoind.zmqpubrawblock=tcp://192.168.68.74:28332
bitcoind.zmqpubrawtx=tcp://192.168.68.74:28333`


Type `journalctl -f -u lnd`
you should see:
`May 21 23:09:38 jvx-minibolt-tmp lnd[812]: 2024-05-21 23:09:38.318 [INF] LTND: Waiting for wallet encryption password. Use `lncli create` to create a wallet, `lncli unlock` to unlock an existing wallet, or `lncli changepassword` to change the password of an existing wallet and unlock it.
May 21 23:09:38 jvx-minibolt-tmp systemd[1]: Started lnd.service - Lightning Network Daemon.`

It has active services and is right at the point where it asks to create the wallet password. From this step:
