Guys, I made a light version of minibolt here, without bitcoind. Just with the setup configurations, tor, i2p, and lnd. In this case, I used LND via git pull and compiled it to ensure the latest available version.

It has active services and is right at the point where it asks to create the wallet password. From this step:

The lnd.conf is complete and commented, for now in tor only, since it is not possible to have two clearnets without changing ports and everything else.
You need to point in lnd.conf to the bitcoin node of whoever wants to use it.
